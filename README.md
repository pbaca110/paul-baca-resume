## Milestone 1 Feedback
This is a decent start. Your general overall direction is outlined, but there is definitely room for further detail. Remember that your Persona should not be about you, but the end-user of your website. It's ok to base a Persona on yourself as an end-user... but the Persona should ultimately be about a _hypothetical end-user of your site_. In your case here, your Persona would probably be either a potential freelance client or someone that is reviewing your work for a job application. It's advisable to include information about what technology they use, and what their technical ability is.

I see you have listed freelance WordPress work as something you would like to pursue. This will definitely have an impact on what kind of content you may want to include down the line. If you're looking for an entry-level developer position at a local company, you'll probably want to feature a section that briefly shows what languages and technology you know how to use, and any other skills that should be highlighted. Daniel Heron has a lot of helpful advice on this.

There are some errors in your HTML, so please see *Edits &amp; Suggestions* below. Your Milestone 1 passes, so you are clear to begin work on Milestone 2&alpha;. I'll be covering this in class on Monday 5/1.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/capstone/rubric/). You have the option to make corrections to your code and content on this Milestone by Monday, and I will bump your grade to [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/capstone/rubric/).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- The &lt;body&gt; element is completely missing from your HTML document. This element should contain all the content that is visible to the end user.
- Watch your indentation.
- Stray &lt;ul&gt; tag on line 23 needs to be deleted.

### Milestone 2&alpha; Feedback
What you have here is a _start_, but this does not give you enough to provide you with a guide for your development. The wireframes are not detailed enough to base your development on, the content strategy does not meet requirements, and the HTML structure of your document is incorrect. 

If you were creating a website for a client or employer, think of what they might want to see in a wireframe and aim for that. This is what we are looking for here.

I don't see any space allocated in your wireframe layouts for any content, and your contact form is missing from the wireframes.

On mobile screens, having each section be 100% across the container is a-ok, but the same is generally not advised on larger/wider screens. Think about organizing your content areas into columns on the desktop layout.

Also, think about the scale of a desktop screen vs. a phone screen. The image you have across the top might need to be a different size on a phone vs. on a big screen. Think about how you might need to do this in CSS, or with Bootstrap. These little details need to be in the wireframe so you have a "roadmap" for your code. 

The paragraph you have is a not sufficient content strategy. What I am looking for is 1-3 sentences for each page section  that describe the kinds of content that you will feature. See [Sample PWP Milestones](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/example/)

A bit of extra work here is required - and this will help your development process go smoothly too. Right now, this milestone does not meet the minimum requirements, and only qualifies for [Tier I](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/) status.

Please complete the **Content Strategy** and **update your HTML structure** at the very minimum. I strongly recommend additional work on your wireframes. Make these changes before the end of the day on Wednesday May 17th 2017 and I will bump your grade to [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/).

## Edits &amp; Suggestions
- HTML structure is incorrect. Please use the proper HTML structure with all required elements and tags.
- Always use the `alt` attribute on all `<img>` tags. 

### Updated Feedback 5/22
This is a great improvement on the wireframes. Now that there's more detail here, you'll have a much better guide for when you start coding. I can already see the grid system and HTML structure just by looking at these wireframes.

Think about lining up some of the content sections and the form a little more consistently, and be careful with the size of the picture at the top. If your content grows and the page starts to get long, I'd think about including a top nav.

Your Content Strategy could still use some improvement, and there are still some issues with the HTML. See Edits &amp; Suggestions below.

Thanks for submitting updates. Your PWP Milestone 2a passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/personal/rubric/). You're clear to begin development on your PWP. Build your layout directly inside the `/public_html` directory. You do not need to use the `/documentation` directory any more.

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- Don't use capital letters in your HTML tags - this is vintage in a bad way.
- Both your `<img>` tags need to be moved up inside the `<body>` tag.
- `<title>` tag is missing
