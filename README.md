## Milestone 1 Feedback
This is a decent start. Your general overall direction is outlined, but there is definitely room for further detail. Remember that your Persona should not be about you, but the end-user of your website. It's ok to base a Persona on yourself as an end-user... but the Persona should ultimately be about a _hypothetical end-user of your site_. In your case here, your Persona would probably be either a potential freelance client or someone that is reviewing your work for a job application. It's advisable to include information about what technology they use, and what their technical ability is.

I see you have listed freelance WordPress work as something you would like to pursue. This will definitely have an impact on what kind of content you may want to include down the line. If you're looking for an entry-level developer position at a local company, you'll probably want to feature a section that briefly shows what languages and technology you know how to use, and any other skills that should be highlighted. Daniel Heron has a lot of helpful advice on this.

There are some errors in your HTML, so please see *Edits &amp; Suggestions* below. Your Milestone 1 passes, so you are clear to begin work on Milestone 2&alpha;. I'll be covering this in class on Monday 5/1.

Your Milestone 1 passes at [Tier II](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/capstone/rubric/). You have the option to make corrections to your code and content on this Milestone by Monday, and I will bump your grade to [Tier III](https://bootcamp-coders.cnm.edu/projects/capstone/rubric/).

### Edits &amp; Suggestions
- The &lt;body&gt; element is completely missing from your HTML document. This element should contain all the content that is visible to the end user.
- Watch your indentation.
- Stray &lt;ul&gt; tag on line 23 needs to be deleted.
