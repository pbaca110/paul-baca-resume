		<P>On my desktop wireframe I was going for people being able to have everything easy to see and to read and more picture heavy to show off my work rather than text. on my mobile wireframe each section  is big  so that its easy to read and to look and and touch on to view the pictures I want the contact info to be easy for them to touch so they don't have to zoom in to click it.  </P>
